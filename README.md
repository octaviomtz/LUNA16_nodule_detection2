# LUNA16_nodule_detection

Repo to perform false positive reduction using the LUNA16 dataset. Each method has its own directory (e.g. FP_reduction_1), with training, testing, and analysis scripts. There is also a script to produce the candidates from the original LUNA16 data (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2595812 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2596478).
